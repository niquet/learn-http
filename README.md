This document started as a place I can come back to whenever I need to refresh knowledge on HTTP. Meanwhile I add or update information whenever I find something new or interesting around the HyperText Transfer Protocol.

Feel free to make a pull request if you want something changed or feel like I'm missing out on something. For now, happy learning and thanks for stopping by. Leave a star if you're happy with this little side project of mine! :star:
