# HTTP :globe_with_meridians:

To not only make this a useful peace of content for me to come back to whenever I have to reread something on the matter, I decided to put together this repository. I am updating this resource whenever I come across something new and interesting about HTTP. 

Feel free to make a pull request if you want something changed or feel like I'm missing out on something. For now, happy learning and thanks for stopping by. Leave a star if you're happy with this little side project of mine! :star:
