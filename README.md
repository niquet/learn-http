# Welcome to Learning About the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) :wave:

Here you will find a compact overview of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This repository was initially dedicated to my own progress, when I first learned about the HyperText Transfer Protocol. Personally, I find it very useful to have a place where all the resources and knowledge one gains in a specific domain is centralized.

To not only make this a useful peace of content for me to come back to whenever I have to reread something on the matter, I decided to put together this repository. I am updating this resource whenever I come across something new and interesting about HTTP. 

Feel free to make a pull request if you want something changed or feel like I'm missing out on something. For now, happy learning and thanks for stopping by. Leave a star if you're happy with this little side project of mine! :star:
